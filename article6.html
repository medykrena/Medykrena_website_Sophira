        <h2>Launching the Sophira Initiative</h2>
        <p><em>Published on August 2, 2025</em></p>
        <p>The Sophira initiative was born out of a simple conviction: every adult deserves access to the jobs of tomorrow. Digitalisation and the ecological transition are reshaping the labour market. Although Switzerland enjoys one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe – about 2.4 % in early 2025 – companies struggle to recruit and several sectors face acute talent shortages【414222387359247†L104-L110】. Healthcare, information technology and renewable energy are among the fields with the fastest‑growing needs【414222387359247†L115-L133】【302319168459486†L46-L64】. In this context, Sophira wants to be a catalyst for inclusion by helping adults who need or wish to change careers find training, guidance and a supportive community.</p>

        <h3>Why launch Sophira?</h3>
        <p>Changing professions has become part of life trajectories. In 2022, about 15.5 % of Swiss workers left their job and nearly half of them moved to another sector【161979465120203†L241-L248】. This mobility can be voluntary – driven by the desire to learn, a search for meaning or family choices – but it can also be triggered by layoffs or health problems【161979465120203†L241-L248】. In parallel, employers report a growing gap between available talent and business needs. Experts estimate that the country could lack around 40 000 IT specialists by 2030【414222387359247†L135-L155】. The healthcare sector already accounts for more than 15 % of job vacancies【414222387359247†L115-L133】. For adults caught between declining industries and emerging opportunities, a structured support system is essential.</p>

        <h3>Programmes and a flexible learning model</h3>
        <p>The Swiss education landscape is rich: more than 212 000 young people follow vocational training each year and 60 % of adults participate in continuing education【213318533845871†L71-L85】【213318533845871†L118-L127】. Yet many training offers are not adapted to adults who already have family or professional commitments. Sophira therefore builds on modular programmes that can be completed while working. For example, the ICT‑Assistant pathway provides a hands‑on introduction to information technology over 800 hours; it is open to people without prior experience and leads to a non‑formal certificate【863326897908625†L139-L164】. The Digital Collaboration Specialist training focuses on change management and innovation and awards a federal diploma【863326897908625†L170-L194】. The Cyber 4 Switzerland programme combines online learning, bootcamp and internship to prepare participants for the federal Cyber Security Specialist exam【863326897908625†L200-L223】. These courses – and others offered by partners such as the Swissmem pilot project for technical trades【605013251932007†L69-L87】 – allow adults to learn new skills without putting their life on hold.</p>

        <h3>A social process</h3>
        <p>Reconversion is not just about acquiring new knowledge. Research shows that it is a relational process influenced by family, networks and institutions【161979465120203†L259-L276】. Social support can boost confidence and motivation, but it can also be a source of pressure or obstacles when finances are tight or when the job market undervalues transferable skills【161979465120203†L259-L276】. Many people in transition experience periods of solitude when they feel misunderstood by their peers or marginalised by institutions【161979465120203†L278-L289】. Sophira therefore emphasises human accompaniment: we offer personalised assessments, peer‑to‑peer workshops and networking events to break isolation and build bridges between learners and employers.</p>

        <h3>Join us</h3>
        <p>Launching Sophira is only the first step. Our vision is to create a fairer future in which everyone can thrive in the digital and ecological transitions. By supporting our initiative – whether through a donation, volunteering or by joining a training programme – you contribute to a movement that restores dignity and opportunity. Together, we can turn systemic barriers into stepping stones towards meaningful work.</p>
