        <h3>Arijanit Idrizi – President</h3>
        <p>
          Arijanit brings over 8 years of solid experience in the field of migration and socio-professional support.
          With a first training in business, he has successfully leveraged his skills in communication, behavioral analysis and problem-solving to thrive in the migration sector and as a freelance data analyst.
          Drawing on this human-centered and strategic experience, he began a professional transition into the field of data science, with the aim of combining his social expertise and analytical skills to deliver innovative, data-driven solutions.
          Having faced several challenges during his own career change, he came up with the idea of creating an association to support others encountering similar obstacles.

          His journey led him through roles in child protection, refugee support, and emergency housing, as well as project leadership at the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and AdO.
          A graduate in Social Work and Public Policy, he merges empirical knowledge with strategic, ethical, and analytical thinking to shape fairer public policy.
          His hybrid vision reinforces Sophira’s mission to enable inclusive and transformative career transitions.
