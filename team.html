        <h2>Our Founders</h2>

<div>
  <h3>Arijanit Idrizi – President</h3>
  <p>
    Arijanit brings over 8 years of solid experience in the field of migration and socio-professional support.
  </p>
    With a first training in business, he has successfully leveraged his skills in communication, behavioral analysis and problem-solving to thrive in the migration sector and as a freelance data analyst.
  </p>
    Drawing on this human-centered and strategic experience, he began a professional transition into the field of data science, with the aim of combining his social expertise and analytical skills to deliver innovative, data-driven solutions.
  </p>
    Having faced several challenges during his own career change, he came up with the idea of creating an association to support others encountering similar obstacles.
  </p>

  <h3>Quôc-Bao Nguyên – Co-President</h3>
  <p>
    With over ten years of frontline experience as a social educator, Quôc-Bao brings deep field knowledge and a strong commitment to social justice. His journey led him through various roles in child protection, refugee support, and emergency housing, where he developed a keen understanding of systemic issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond his fieldwork, he has held project leadership roles in organizations such as the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) and AdO, where he worked on interdisciplinary initiatives like the One Million Youth Action Challenge (1MYAC).
  </p>
  <p>
    A graduate of the University of Fribourg with a Master’s degree in Social Work and Public Policy, he combines empirical knowledge with strategic, ethical, and analytical thinking. His goal is to shape public policy through an approach that bridges bottom-up experience and top-down impact — particularly in defending children's rights and promoting equal access to social services.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Co-President of Sophira, Quôc-Bao provides thoughtful leadership and a vision rooted in both research and reality. His hybrid approach reinforces Sophira’s mission to create fair, inclusive pathways for professional reinvention through data science.
